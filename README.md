# PythonRSACryptosystem
A tech sample of how to implement the RSA cryptosystem for client/server communcations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This repository contains the necessary functions required to perform RSA encryption and decryption.
 The RSA cryptosystem is one of the oldest public key encryption schemes and also one of the most widely used encryption schemes.
 As such, this file serves as a strong reference for anyone interested in the subject and application of encryption schemes.
 For mathematical proofs of the RSA Cryptosystem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) has great resources.
